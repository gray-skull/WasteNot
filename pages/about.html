              <p>
                WasteNot is a web application that helps users reduce food waste by
                providing recipes based on the ingredients they have at home. By using
                WasteNot, you can save money, reduce your carbon footprint, and help the
                environment.

            <div class="howItWorks-content">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  WasteNot uses a database of recipes and ingredients to suggest meals based on what you already have at home. Simply enter the ingredients you have, and WasteNot will provide you with a list of recipes you can make.
                </li>
                <li>
                  WasteNot attempts to prioritize recipes that maximize the use of the ingredients you have, so you can use up as much as possible before it goes bad.
                </li>
                <li>
                  WasteNot also provides nutritional information for each recipe, so you can make healthier choices and track your intake. You can also save your favorite recipes for later.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On a special diet? Have allergies? No problem! WasteNot allows you to filter recipes based on dietary restrictions and allergies, and you can save these preferences for future use (when logged in).
                </li>
                <li>
                  WasteNot is a free service, and you don't need to create an account to use it. However, creating an account allows you to save your dietary and allergy preferences, and your favorite recipes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  WasteNot is a work in progress, and we are constantly adding new features and recipes. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let us know.
